# Sales Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive sales analysis for using Python to derive insights, product recommendations, sales report comparisons, and marketing campaigns comparisons. The goal is to provide key metric indicators that can inform marketing strategies and aid in decision-making processes.

## Objectives
1. **Merge and Clean Data**: Consolidate 12 datasets into a single cohesive dataset.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Perform data cleaning tasks including removing null values, formatting data, and ensuring correct data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to uncover trends and insights from the sales data.
4. **Sales Estimations**: Estimate future sales based on historical data.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Test hypotheses to understand factors influencing sales.

## Description

### Data Wrangling
- **Task**: Removed null values, formatted the data, and ensured correct data types.
- **Outcome**: A clean and well-structured dataset ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Best Area for Sales**: Identified that San Francisco had the highest sales, followed by Los Angeles and New York City.

### Hypothesis Testing
- **Hypothesis**: Higher prices negatively affect sales volumes.

- **Result**: The hypothesis was proven false. The analysis showed that price did not significantly affect the sales volumes of products.

By following these steps, the project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to optimize sales strategies and improve marketing effectiveness.
